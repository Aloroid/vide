# Components

Components are custom-made reusable pieces of UI made from other pieces of UI.

By using components you can make your application more modular and better
organized.

```lua [Button.lua]
local function Button(props: {
    Position: UDim2,
    Text: string,
    Activated: () -> ()
})
    return create "TextButton" {
        BackgroundColor3 = Color3.fromRGB(50, 50, 50),
        Size = UDim2.fromOffset(200, 150),

        Position = props.Position,
        Text = props.Text,
        Activated = props.Activated
    }
end

return Button
```

```lua [App.lua]
local Button = require(Button)

local function App()
    return create "ScreenGui" {
        Button {
            Position = UDim2.fromOffset(200, 200),
            Text = "click me!",

            Activated = function()
                print "clickeD"
            end
        }
    }
end

root(App).Parent = game.StarterGui
```

Above is a simple example of a button component with its background color set to
a dark grey and with a fixed size.

A single parameter `props` is used to pass properties to the component.
Creating instances of this button component is as simple as doing the below:

```lua
local button = Button {
    Position = UDim2.new(),
    Text = "Click me!",

    Activated = function()
        print "clicked"
    end
}
```

Components allow you to *encapsulate* behavior. You can only modify the
component in ways that you allow in the component.

This also promotes code reusability. Anytime you want a new button all you do
is call `Button {}` instead of creating and setting every property each time.

This can be extended to much more complicated UI.
