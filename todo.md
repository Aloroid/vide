# todo

- better error reporting and stack traces in strict mode
- auto-enable of strict mode depending on compiler optimizaton level
- investigate if weak table iteration can be invalidated
- property binding optimization
  - would no longer allow `cleanup()` usage in binding scopes
- solution to nested reactivity, see: SolidJS stores
- SolidJS control flow components
- equality checking of derived sources
- investigate performance of wide graphs
- optimize child removal
- implement from solid:
  - Show
  - Switch
  - Dynamic
  - Portal
  - batch
- optimize `indexes()` double-diffing
